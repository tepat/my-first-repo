      I wanted to do something minimal with wave, several waves, with different speed and color. and to interact with them
      so i build wave with 3 circles, 2 below and 1 above.
      The challenge was to multiplicate object, and reutilisate them in the 3 pannel
      and animate their property differently as they have the same classname, .
      so now, I think I should have used SVG
      And I learn the concept of ::before and ::after selector in css, that I have already heard about, but never used.
